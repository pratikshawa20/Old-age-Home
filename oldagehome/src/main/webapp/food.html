<h1><u>Food and Nutrition</u></h1><br><br><br>
<h3><p>In old-age homes, food is served in a mess-style cafeteria. You can choose between veg or non-veg food depending on your dietary preferences. However, there are no facilities for you to cook on your own. 
<p>Old-age Home is highly-skilled cooks, exercising their culinary craft in a clean and hygienic environment, ensure your food is always novel, appetising and above all, healthy. There are dedicated, segregated kitchens preparing vegetarian and non-vegetarian food, and scrupulous care is taken to ensure all linen and cutlery, both in the kitchens and at the dining hall, is also segregated and spotlessly clean.
<p>Join your friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner at the dining hall, with a different menu every day to tickle your taste and fancy. And should you desire the flavour of home-cooked food, we provide a kitchenette in the dining hall for private use of residents, so you can prepare your favourite dish in your own way, whenever you want.
