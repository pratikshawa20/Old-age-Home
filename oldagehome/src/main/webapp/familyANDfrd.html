<h1><u>Hosting family and friends (Disabled friendly)</u></h1><br><br>
<h3><p> Old-age homes have fixed visiting hours. Inmates can receive their friends and family only during these hours. It is not possible for your children and grandchildren to stay with you.
<p>All rooms in the Care Unit are disabled-friendly to ensure maximum mobility and a dedicated assistance station is built into every floor. Similarly, dining facilities are also present on every floor so that residents have easy access to fresh, nourishing food prepared with an emphasis on hygiene and safety.
<p>With mobility-friendly rooms, round-the-clock attention, healthy meal services and consulting doctors on call, we make every effort to ensure chronic illness or disability does not limit your enjoyment of life at Old-age Home.
<p>Life with disability need not be reduced or unfulfilled - at Old-age Home we make concerted efforts to ensure residents of our Assisted Living facility have all the support, attention and encouragement they need to participate in and enjoy our convivial atmosphere.
